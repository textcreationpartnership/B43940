            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Seasonable ADVICE and necessary CAÆ²TIONS to the Citizens and Livery-Men of <hi>London,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Election of a <hi>Lord-Mayor</hi> for the Year en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IT is not thought convenient that any Person who was for Surrendring the City-Charter, and would blindly follow the Dictates of a Popish Prince, ought to be chosen Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate of this famous City.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether an easy and unsteady Person, that has been several times imposed on already, to act contrary to the known Rights of the Citizens, in two several Ward-motes in the Ward of <hi>Bishops-gate,</hi> at ten Years distance from each other, (<hi>viz.</hi> before the City-Rights were invaded, and the first Year after their Rights were restored) be a fit Person to be chosen Lord-Mayor?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether Sir <hi>Jonathan Râd,</hi> whom the Jacobites and Non-Swearers are so zealous to promote to the Chair, in full Assurance from their constant Familiarity with him, that they shall manage him as they please, to the prejudice of the Present Government, be a fit Person to be elected Lord-Mayor in so critical a time as this is?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether he that was a Steward to the Tory-Apprentices Feast, which was managed by the late Lord <hi>Jefferies</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger L' Estrange,</hi> in order to corrupt the Apprentices of this City, and to animate them against their Masters, be a fit Person to be intrusted with the Chief Magistracy?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether it may not be reasonably supposed that Sir <hi>Jonathan Râd</hi> was for Surrendring the Charter of <hi>London;</hi> because af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgment was entred against it, eight worthy Aldermen, who would not comply therewith, were turn'd out, and seventeen or eighteen kept in by Commission during pleasure, of which number Sir <hi>Jonathan</hi> was one?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether Sir <hi>Jonathan Râd,</hi> who came from the Sessions-House to the King's-head Tavern in <hi>Leaden-hall-street, Anno</hi> 1683, and with great Joy told some Gentlemen there, that the Jury had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> and that they had done like honest Men, be a fit Person to be Lord-Mayor of this City?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether Sir <hi>Jonathan Râd,</hi> who recommended a Jacobite Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to preach at <hi>Tunbridg-Wells</hi> to the Nobility and Gentry, in the Year 1692, who omitted praying for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:208715:3"/>(for which he there received a severe Reprimand from a Person in great Authority,) whether it may not reasonably be supposed Sir <hi>Jonathan</hi> to be a Jacobite, who preferred such a Man to preach before such an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory? Likewise his Son, Sir <hi>Gemmitt Râd,</hi> pays double Taxes for not taking the Oaths to their Present Majesties, and keeps one <hi>Hart</hi> a Non-swearing Parson for his Chaplain, who quitted two Preferments ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he would comply to take the said Oaths.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Sir <hi>Jonathan Râd</hi> lately going from the Jacobite Rendezvous at <hi>Bath,</hi> to <hi>Bristol</hi>-Fair, and being in company of Mr. <hi>John Bub,</hi> the late Sheriff and others, began K. <hi>James</hi>'s Health; and whether this may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to be chosen Lord-Mayor by all such as would be thought Friends to the Present Government?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Sir <hi>Jonathan Râd</hi> keeping near an hundred Pounds of Dissenters Money, due to the Crown, in his hands for above ten Years, till Captain <hi>Henry Baker,</hi> who with others was commission'd by the King to enquire into all Frauds of that kind, discovering of it, obliged him to pay it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was kept for the use of the Orphans, or rather for maintaining Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite Parsons, is left to the Consideration of all good Citizens.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And now consider whether so weak and easy a Man as Sir <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Râd</hi> is by his very Friends esteemed to be, [Witness Mrs. <hi>James</hi>'s Paper on the Election for last <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> who is a great Stickler for Sir <hi>Jonathan;</hi> and did not question but God would give him Wisdom when he came into the Chair, thereby implying that he had it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,] and who is solely under the Conduct and Government of the late Deputy <hi>Lâm,</hi> and the rest of the Jacobite Party, be a fit Person to be chosen Lord Mayor for the Year ensuing.</p>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, consider the Character of the above-mentioned Person in these few things (of many) offered to your serious Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And it is also evident that the present Cabals of the Jacobites are to use their utmost Endeavours to carry him for Lord-Mayor of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that so if any Accident or Difficulty should happen to the present Government, (which God prevent) he may be ready to assist them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the late abdicated King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> We hope you will always esteem and have a due Regard to those Citizens who have approved themselves faithful, and shewed themselves zealous for the maintaining of the Rights and Liberties of this famous City in the worst of Times, and are of known Loyalty and Affection to their present Majesties; among the Number of which none are thought more fit to be recommended to your present Choice than Sir <hi>William Ashhurst</hi> and Sir <hi>John H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 chunk">
